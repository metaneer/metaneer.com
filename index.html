        <h2>What I Do</h2>
        <p>I've spent the last 15 years shipping software for start-ups and innovation groups within larger companies. My specialty is zero to one - rapidly translating innovative ideas into fully functional mobile and web applications. I provide end-to-end development services, from initial concept to launched product. My approach is structured and efficient, ensuring that each project is precisely defined, meticulously planned, and expertly executed. Since 2010, I've worked with countless technologies & platforms and delivered dozens of projects to market on time and on budget.</p>
        <p>When you work with MetaNeer Labs, you're working directly with me, Andrew Bellay. This personal approach ensures that your project gets the attention and expertise it deserves. And due to the requirements of this hands-on approach, <b>I only work with three clients at a time.</b></p>
        <p>Email me (<a id="eaddress1" href="#"></a>) to see if we're a good fit.</p>
        <img src="/img/MetaNeer-Clients.jpeg" alt="Past Clients" title="Past Clients">
        <div class="client-image-caption">(some of my past clients & products)</div>
        <h2>What I Don't Do</h2>
        <p>While I offer a comprehensive suite of development services, there are certain areas I don't cover:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>One-Size-Fits-All Solutions:</strong> I don't provide generic solutions. Every project is unique, and I tailor my offering to fit the specific needs and goals of each client.</li>
            <li><strong>Standalone Consulting:</strong> Although I offer strategic advice as part of the development process, I don't typically engage in consulting projects that aren't tied to an actual build or implementation.</li>
            <li><strong>Maintenance-Only Contracts:</strong> I focus on full-cycle development, from inception to deployment. While I provide support post-launch, I don't take on maintenance-only projects. It's just not my jam and not a wise use of your money.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>My Philosophy & Approach</h2>
        <p>My product development philosophy centers on clarity, precision, and collaboration. I believe that the best software solutions arise from a clear understanding of the client's vision, the user's needs, a well-defined scope, a disciplined process, and a willingness to adapt and learn new things. Here's an outline of my process:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Collaborative Ideation:</strong> I start by working with you to get all of your ideas on paper and refining them until we have a clear and exciting vision for the project. This phase involves a lot of back-and-forth to ensure we are on the same page and to minimize future miscommunications. We define hypotheses to test, agree on priorities, and search for dependencies and risks that could lead us to failure. Resources are finite, so entrepreneurs must get feedback on their ideas from the market before running out of time and money. My goal is to give you as many chances as possible to hit a home run.</li>
            <li><strong>Technical Specification:</strong> Once we have a concrete vision, I translate it into a detailed written technical specification, user flows, and interface designs. These artifacts are crucial for guiding the development process and ensuring that everyone has a clear and unified understanding of exactly what we are building. We'll also plan out and tackle technical tests and POCs to buy down any high-risk issues we've uncovered.</li>
            <li><strong>Assembling the Right Team:</strong> I bring together a team of specialists who are experts in their respective fields, whether it's iOS, Android, web development, firmware, machine learning, or any other area required for your project. This customized approach ensures that we can deliver high-quality results efficiently and cost-effectively.</li>
            <li><strong>Development and Testing:</strong> With a solid plan and the right team in place, we move into the development phase. Communication is key so you'll hear how things are going every day. But more importantly, you'll get your hands on new working software every few days so you can see, feel, and test for yourself. While feedback is essential and welcomed throughout every stage of the process, large changes to scope during the development phase will likely cause delays and added expense.</li>
            <li><strong>Launch and Beyond:</strong> As the planned development phase winds down and the first version of your product becomes complete, I work with you to execute on our launch plan. After launch, we celebrate, perform a retro, and determine next steps, whether that's planning the next phase of development, finding you a CTO, or adapting your marketing plan based on our initial learnings.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>I aim to ship a completed first version of a typical project within four weeks, max. This rapid timeline is only possible due to my disciplined adherence to a streamlined and battle-tested process and dedicated focus to just 3 active clients.</p>
        
        <h2>Can You Give Me An Estimate?</h2>
        <p>After some initial discovery and a signed contract, the typical project takes 3-4 weeks to scope, design, develop, test, and launch. You should expect to spend between $7k and $20k per week, depending on how many engineers we need to hire, how in demand their skills are, and how big of a hurry you're in. I've shipped a lot of amazing software for under $40,000.</p>
        
        <h2>How This Usually Works</h2>
        <p>The typical software development process goes something like this: the service provider tells you - the client - an hourly rate, you explain your project, and the service provider estimates how long the work will take. The problem is that now the service provider is incentivized to under-estimate the duration of the work so that you'll award them your business. They're incentivized to ignore or put-off high-risk and hard problems until later. Then, a few months later, you're abruptly informed that the team needs more time (and money) to complete the work. You’re faced with the difficult decision of either abandoning the project or paying more money to hopefully get your project across the finish line. You take all the risk and have no control or guarantees. <b>I don't like being on either side of this deal, so I choose not to run my business this way.</b></p>
        <p>This is why I don’t charge by the hour anymore either - it drives a wedge between what's good for you and what's good for me. Charging by the hour incentives me to bill for more hours rather than to ship functioning software. It also requires me to maintain timesheets for everyone working on the project, which is an annoyance and distraction.</p>
        <p>I do things differently. I guarantee you a dedicated block of time at a transparent, fair, and no-gotchas price. We then ruthlessly refine the scope of your project, removing unnecessary bits that will distract from testing your core hypotheses or work that we can easily roll out later (ie: do we really need password recovery for your MVP?). We make the scope fit your timeline and budget, dig deep into the details, eliminate project-killing technical risks by building quick POCs, and break the work into precise, technical, and bite-size chunks that a talented engineer can develop without a lot of back and forth. Together we identify the must-have features and then I commit to delivering them to you. This dramatically reduces expensive misunderstandings early in the process and not after we've already begun development.</p>

        <h2>Are We A Good Fit?</h2>
        <p>Working together will be awesome if you:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Value Transparency, Clarity & Precision:</strong> You appreciate honesty, detailed planning, and clear communication. My process is designed to minimize misunderstandings and ensure that everyone is on the same page from start to finish.</li>
            <li><strong>Want a Collaborator:</strong> You are willing to work closely with me and a team, providing input and feedback throughout the development process. Successful (and fun) projects are built on strong collaboration and mutual understanding.</li>
            <li><strong>Need Specialized Expertise:</strong> You have a project that requires specialized knowledge and skills. I interview and assemble teams of experts tailored to the specific needs of your project. I only work with A-team developers -- the alternative is too slow, mistake-riddled, and expensive and it doesn't bring me joy.</li>
            <li><strong>Seek End-to-End Solutions:</strong> You need more than just advice or maintenance. I provide comprehensive development services, taking your project from initial concept to launch and beyond.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If this resonates with you, then we should talk to see if there's a potential fit.</p>
        <p>Email me (<a id="eaddress2" href="#"></a>) and we can set up a quick 30 minute call.</p>
